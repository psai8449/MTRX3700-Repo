We have several versions of our robot code: 
-  robot: which is the most basic version which we can gaurantee will work if given the opportunity to demonstrate
-  advance robot: which is similar to robot but also integrates the bluetooth module, can gaurantee that it works
-  hopeful robot: A step up from advanced robot, integrates microphone module, can't garauntee it works

OUR FINAL PROJECT FOLDER IS THE HOPEFUL ROBOT

In IR - Proximity - IOT demo video we demonstrate the robot basically fully integrated and functioning, demonstrates how IOT, proximity sensor and IR remote all working in harmony.

Unfortunately, video of the bluetooth module working was not taken although we can gaurantee it works.

Video of the motors working is available but not in harmony with the fully integrate module. Video of the motors working with the IR remote is available although has not been provided because canvas only allows us to upload one video. The video we've submitted does actually have the functioning motor control code integrated into it, it just wasn't demonstrated in this video, we can gaurantee that this works if given the opporunity to demonstrate.

Video of the microphone code working individually is available but we did not get the opportunity to integrate and test, the hopeful robot project file is our final code and it does have the microphone code integrated into it and should work in theory as the microphone code functions quite simply.
